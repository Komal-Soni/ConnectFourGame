The game is played on a 7x6 grid. Players take turns dropping one of their colored discs from
the top into a column. The disc can fall only into the lowest available space within the column. The first
player to form an unbroken chain of four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. The
game is considered a draw if the board is filled without any player achieving a connect four. 
Implement the basic game logic, including initializing the board, handling player moves, checking
for a win or draw condition, and alternating turns between players using minimax algorithm
